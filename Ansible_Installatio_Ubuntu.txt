Installing Ansible on Ubuntu
============================

Step 1 — Installing Ansible

First, refresh your system’s package index with:

$   sudo apt update


$   sudo apt install ansible



Step 2 — Setting Up the Inventory File

The inventory file contains information about the hosts you’ll manage with Ansible.

$   sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts           --------------- you can also use Vi editor


Whenever you want to check your inventory, you can run:

$   ansible-inventory --list -y


Step 3 — Testing Connection

After setting up the inventory file to include your servers, it’s time to check if Ansible is able to connect to these servers and run commands via SSH.

You can use the -u argument to specify the remote system user. When not provided, Ansible will try to connect as your current system user on the control node.

From your local machine or Ansible control node, run:



$   ansible all -m ping -u root

This command will use Ansible’s built-in ping module to run a connectivity test on all nodes from your default inventory, connecting as root. The ping module will test:

if hosts are accessible;
if you have valid SSH credentials;
if hosts are able to run Ansible modules using Python.
